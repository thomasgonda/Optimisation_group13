Group 13 Optimisation code repository
13/12/2019

Hello and welcome!

This is the code repository for the optimisation assignment of Group 13 on a sailing hybrid cargo ship.
All of the code is written in MATLAB under an educational license. Need to download the optimisation toolbox.

This is comprised of 3 subsystems:
- Subsystem 1: Sail+mast design, Thomas Gonda
  - No data set required
  - All of the code is under one file
- Subsystem 2: Hull design, Laerke Mop Rasmussen
- Subsystem 3: Operations, Ryan Dai

Enjoy. Merry christmas and happy holidays!
